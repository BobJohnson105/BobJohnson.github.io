<b>Virtual</b> - <i>not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so.</i> <br>
<b>Dustpan</b> - <i>a flat handheld receptacle into which dust and waste can be swept from the floor.</i>

<b>Virtual Dustpan</b> - A digital collection of nonsesne I have deemed worthy to "sweep together" and deposit for your entertainment. Maybe some of it will be useful or cool, who knows...

This site is the first in a range of virtual Dustpan endeavours I have planned- it was made using the open-source static site generator jekyll and hosted with github pages. Extra functionality for my site including the theme (Moonwalk) was gratefully provided by the user <b>abhinavs</b> on Github whose profile I have linked! If you would also like to try out their moonwalk theme I have linked that too!
