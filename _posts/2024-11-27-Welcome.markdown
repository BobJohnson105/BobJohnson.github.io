Hello all and weclome to <b>Virtual Dustpan</b>! 

What is Virtual Dustpan? Well am I glad you asked! Virtual Dustpan is my own personal blog and
portfolio site, a one-stop-shop for all things videogames, tech, film... you name it! I find there to be
something quite fun about shouting about stuff into the void that is the internet, and so I thought what better way to do that than set up a blog?

Hopefully you might stick around and explore, take a look at some of the silly little projects I am working on? (Please do they really are quite silly)

Anyhow, over and out from me for now! Until next time loyal readers! (You don't know it but I have now consumed a part of your soul)

Dylan.
